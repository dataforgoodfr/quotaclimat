# QuotaClimat x Data For Good
![](quotaclimat/utils/coverquotaclimat.png)
The aim of this work is to deliver a tool to [QuotaClimat](https://www.quotaclimat.org/ "Quotaclimat website"), allowing them to quantify the media coverage of the climate crisis. By the mean of sitemap scrapping (among others data sources), a Streamlit dashboard is developed to answer their needs.

### :nut_and_bolt: Setting up the environment
Doing the following step will enable your local environement to be aligned with the one of any other collaborator.

First install pyenv:

<table>
<tr>
<td> OS </td> <td> Command </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> MacOS </td>
<td>

```bash
cd -
brew install pyenv # pyenv itself
brew install pyenv-virtualenv # integration with Python virtualenvsec
```
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Ubuntu </td>
<td>

```bash
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev

curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Make the shell pyenv aware:

<table>
<tr>
<td> OS </td> <td> Command </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> MacOS </td>
<td>

```bash
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Ubuntu </td>
<td>

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>



Let's install a python version:
```bash
pyenv install 3.10.2 # this will take time
```
Check if it works properly, this command:
```bash
pyenv versions
```
should return:
```bash
  system
  3.10.2
```

Then you are ready to create a virtual environment. Go in the project folder, and run:
```bash
  pyenv virtualenv 3.10.2 quotaclimat
  pyenv local quotaclimat
```

You now need a tool to manage dependencies. Let's use poetry.

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry update
```

When you need to install a new dependency (use a new package, e.g. nltk), run 
```bash
poetry add ntlk
```

After commiting to the repo, other team members will be able to use the exact same environment you are using. 


### Run the dashboard
```bash
poetry run streamlit run app.py
```

### Fix linting
Before committing, make sure that the line of codes you wrote are conform to PEP8 standard by running:
```bash
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
poetry run flake8 .
```
There is a debt regarding the cleanest of the code right now. Let's just not make it worth for now.
